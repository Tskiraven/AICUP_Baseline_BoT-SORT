#####　　pycocotools can't install without Microsoft C++　　#### 

so i try to install pycocotools-windows, and it works.

It seemed initially feasible, but when running FastReID, an error occurs in the last epoch:

final i try to pip install pycocotools, suddenly it can works

but i don't have more time to try it could not success on the final epoch.

beacause i can't install faiss-gpu so i install faiss-cpu,

doesn't have any problem?
